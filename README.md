# Muzammil-UI
The main working files of the project are 
index.html
custom.css
app.js

all other files are libraries.

index.html >>> This file contains all the html of the project, with commented block to recognize them seperately.

custom.css >> contains all the styles of the project and some default library overridden styles.

app.js >>> controls the flow of the project including screens, events, functions, library initializers etc. Whole project is based on this file. The blocks are well commented and function names are self defined, making it easier to tweak for upgrades.
